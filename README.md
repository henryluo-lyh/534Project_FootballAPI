## Description and Motivation of the API
- Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in the world. Many people are closely following various professional football leagues and discussing the performance of different players. Football fans often find themselves in debates regarding who is the better player or which team is the better team. Most football websites and apps have the player and team stats for the fans to reference, but many of them don't allow parallel comparisons between players and teams with the stats visualized and overlaid. This project will allow users to directly compare key stats between two players or two teams with the stats visualized and overlaid, allowing easy and straightforward comparison. 

- This API will allow users to select two players to compare their performance in a specific season. Users can specify which season and which league to search for. The API can access data from most of the professional leagues such as La Liga, Premier League, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga as well as North America's MLS and the Chinese Super League. An overlaid bar chart or radar chart will be rendered showing the key stats of the players and teams, allowing the user to compare the stats at a glance quickly. Players of different positions (attacker, midfielder, defender) will compare specific stats relevant to their positions. 

## Intended users and outcome
- Football fans who wants to find out quickly who is the better player or which team is the better team
- A quick and easy reference to visualized player or team stats without having to switch between multiple webpages
