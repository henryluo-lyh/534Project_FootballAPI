I finished the visualization module, which include 2 funcions: vis_bar() and vis_radar. For vis_bar(), it produce a unstacked bar graph, the x axis is value and y axis is stat. I assign different color to each player, which helps to categorize the data points. Furthermore, vis_radar() use the plotly package, and helps to make a radar graph. The flaw of radar graph is that it did not scaled, so even some player has full-mark, the edged of the radar graph cannot be reached. This will be improved in later days.
