https://github.com/henryluo-lyh/534Project_FootballAPI/commit/5a84bfd1e4ea338ab17aae0963888f6c212f96e6   
Finished data wrangling and search functions in the search_process module.   
This Module reads the csv produced by the extract module, wrangle it and allow user to search two players by name   
from the dataset. The search result is returned as a data frame, which is then pivoted longer, making it visualization ready.    

Deleted the draft "visualizer.ipynb" which contains all the functions of "search_process.py" and simple plot function to check if the data frame is visualization ready.
